# Data_exploration_project
This repository contains the work done during my internship at Future Intern. The project involves various tasks centered around the Titanic dataset, including data cleaning, statistical analysis, and data visualization.

Project Description
During my internship, I was assigned several tasks aimed at refining and analyzing the Titanic dataset. The key tasks included:

Data Cleaning:

Removing missing values.
Identifying and removing outliers.
Ensuring data consistency and accuracy.
Statistical Analysis:

Calculating key statistical measures such as mean, mode, and median.
Analyzing the distribution and central tendencies of various features.
Data Visualization:

Creating histograms to visualize data distributions.
Developing other visualizations to gain insights from the dataset.
Repository Structure
data/: Contains the original and cleaned Titanic dataset files.
scripts/: Includes all the SQL scripts used for data cleaning and analysis.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with detailed analysis and visualizations.
README.md: Project description and overview.
Technologies Used
MySQL for data cleaning and statistical analysis.
Python (with libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib) for data visualization.
Git and GitHub for version control and project collaboration.
Conclusion
This project showcases my ability to handle real-world data through a structured process of cleaning, analysis, and visualization. It demonstrates the skills I have developed during my internship
at Future intern and my capability to deliver insightful data analyses.
