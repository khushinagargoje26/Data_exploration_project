#TASK1:Clean a dataset by removing missing values and outliers.


#Step 1:Create Schema titanic then omport data from Datasets 

SELECT * FROM titanic.train;
#Step 2 : Remove rows with NULL values in Age or Embarked columns
DELETE FROM train
WHERE Age IS NULL OR Embarked IS NULL;

#Step 3: Calculate row count and offsets for Q1 and Q3
SET @row_count = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM train);
SET @q1_offset = ROUND(@row_count * 0.25);
SET @q3_offset = ROUND(@row_count * 0.75);

#Step 4: Prepare and execute statements to calculate Q1 and Q3
SET @sql_q1 = CONCAT('SELECT Fare INTO @Q1 FROM train ORDER BY Fare LIMIT 1 OFFSET ', @q1_offset);
SET @sql_q3 = CONCAT('SELECT Fare INTO @Q3 FROM train ORDER BY Fare LIMIT 1 OFFSET ', @q3_offset);

PREPARE stmt_q1 FROM @sql_q1;
EXECUTE stmt_q1;
DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt_q1;

PREPARE stmt_q3 FROM @sql_q3;
EXECUTE stmt_q3;
DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt_q3;

-- Step 5: Calculate IQR and define lower and upper bounds
SET @IQR = @Q3 - @Q1;
SET @LowerBound = @Q1 - 1.5 * @IQR;
SET @UpperBound = @Q3 + 1.5 * @IQR;


-- Step 6: Remove outliers based on Fare
DELETE FROM train
WHERE Fare < @LowerBound OR Fare > @UpperBound;


-- Check for missing values in other columns
SELECT *
FROM train
WHERE Pclass IS NULL OR Name IS NULL OR Sex IS NULL OR SibSp IS NULL OR Parch IS NULL OR Ticket IS NULL OR Cabin IS NULL;


-- Calculate mean and standard deviation for Age and Fare
SELECT AVG(Age) AS mean_age, STDDEV(Age) AS stddev_age, AVG(Fare) AS mean_fare, STDDEV(Fare) AS stddev_fare
FROM train;
